# Wax Pen: A tool to enable production of raised lines using inexpensive parts and readily available crayons.

## Characteristics
* Creates a thin, well-defined line of wax on paper
* A hand-held device which is comfortable to use and easy to manipulate. Current
thinking is pen-shaped
* The device is safe to use by children aged four and up.
* Heat the end of the crayon to the point where the wax changes state to a
liquid
* Control heat so that only the end of the crayon is melted. This is not yet
done
* Control flow of melted wax through a small hole such that the melted wax
hardens nearly immediately on contact with paper.
* The wax flow and melting of wax is continuous only when the tip is moving on a
surface
* The line is well-defined and should not be easily removed from the paper

## Prototype description
### Bill of Materials
* 1 small oral syringe forms the body of the device
* 1 crayon with paper removed
* 1 length multi stranded copper wire, insulation removed twice the length of the
syringe plus about 4 cm forms a heatsync to protect the resistor and a wick to
deliver wax from the resistor to the paper

### Electronic circuit
* 1 3.3 ohm carbon film resistor 1/4 watt
* 2 lengths of thin insulated wire 3 cm longer than the syringe
* 1 4.2V 1200 Mah NiMH rechargeable battery from an electronic cigarette with
on/off button
* 1 momentary push button of the battery does not contain this button

## Assembly
1. Remove plunger from syringe and set aside
2. Make two holes for the thin insulated connecting wire in the end of the syringe on either side of the tip.
3. Pass one piece of wire through each hole until the ends emerge from the top of the syringe
4. Tape the ends near the tip of the syringe to hold them temperarily
5. strip about 1 cm of insulation from both ends of each wire
6. Solder the ends of the wires at the top of the syringe to the resistor as close to the resistor body as possible
7. Clip resistor leads as close to the solder joint as possible
8. remove any strands from the uninsulated copper wire that are shorter than the  others
9. Twist the uninsulated copper wire so that the strands do not come apart
10. fold the uninsulated multi strand copper wire in half around the resistor body - being careful that the copper should not touch your solder joints
11. twist the wire tightly so the copper is tight against the resistor body. (This is your heat sync which prevents the resistor from overheating)
12. twist the ends of the copper wire together and feed the whole thing from the top of the syringe through the tip.
13. Pull the insulated connecting wires, and the copper heat sync wire slowly so the resistor goes into the syringe until it hits the tip and cannot move anymore.
14. test the resistance across the two insulated wires. If it is not 4.3 ohms, you have a short somewhere and need to fix it
15. tape or hot glue the insulated wires so the resistor cannot shift
16. pull and cut off the heat sync copper wire so that only about 3 mm sticks out of the syringe tip
17. connect insulated leads to battery
18. remove paper from crayon and insert into syringe

## Use
The first time you turn on the battery, you may have to press gently on the
crayon to start the flow of wax.
When the line is too thick, or wax is not immediately hardening  on the paper,
release the button so the resistor can cool a little.
This is where we need heat regulation
